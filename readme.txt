These are the programs I collected, modified, or wrote as an intern at the PCC
src/video_modify_new_clean_multifolder.py looks in a folder of folders and adds OIDs to the .mp4 file names and adds those OIDs to the Excel sheets.
src/video_metadata_downloader.py pulls, formats for archival, and writes to an Excel sheet metadata from a YouTube video, playlist, or channel.
